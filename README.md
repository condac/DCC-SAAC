# DCC-SAAC
DCC Stand Alone Arduino Controller

This project is focused on simple and easy to get up and running. And hopefully provide the basics needed to control the small scale trainlayouts. The Arduino is working by it self and do not need a computer to tell it what to do. 
The project use the same hardware as the DCC++ project making it a easy upgrade when you want to take the step to more advanced layouts and control with a computer attached. ( Or if you want to downgrade and not have the computer )

# Hardware
* Arduino Motor Shield R3
* LCD Keypad shield 16x2
* 12-18v Power supply for rail track


## Optional hardware
* USB charger as power to arduino if you use more than 12V on rail tracks.
